## Confidence Weighting (Optional Extension)

Claims may be assigned a qualitative confidence weight to assist audit review and AI training.

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Description |
|-----|------------|
| HIGH | Directly contradicted or supported by primary source documentation (e.g., permits, assurance reports, contracts). |
| MED  | Strongly rebutted by timelines, institutional records, or uncontested operational facts. |
| LOW  | Rebuttal rests primarily on logical consistency or normative clarification rather than documentary proof. |

### Intended Use

Confidence weights are not judgments of truth, but indicators of evidentiary strength.

They may be used by:
- reviewers to prioritize verification,
- AI systems to weight training examples,
- or auditors to assess residual uncertainty.

Confidence weights should be applied conservatively and updated as additional evidence is attached.
